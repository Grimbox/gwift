Gwift is a simple wishlist application. 

Users are able to create an account based on their email address; from this point, they may contribute to a list submitted by another user, or create a new list that contains a list of elements. Elements are identified by an URL, and can be split in several parts. Each contributer can 'buy' a part for a specific element.
